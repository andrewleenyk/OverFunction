Add your image files here to appear in the gallery.

Supported extensions (case-insensitive):
- .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp

Notes:
- Files are discovered by reading the web server's directory listing at /images/.
- If your server doesn't expose listings, create a small JSON manifest instead at /images/images.json containing:
  ["img1.jpg","img2.png", ...]
  and the gallery will fall back to it.
